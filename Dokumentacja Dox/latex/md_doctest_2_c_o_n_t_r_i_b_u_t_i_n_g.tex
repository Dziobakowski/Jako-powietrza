This library is free, and will stay free but needs your support to sustain its development. There are lots of \href{https://github.com/doctest/doctest/issues/600}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{new features}}}} and maintenance to do. If you work for a company using {\bfseries{doctest}} or have the means to do so, please consider financial support.

Consider opening an issue for a discussion before making a pull request to make sure the contribution goes smoothly.

All pull requests should be made against the {\ttfamily dev} branch because the {\ttfamily master} is the stable one with the latest release.

If you\textquotesingle{}re going to change something in the library itself -\/ make sure you don\textquotesingle{}t modify {\ttfamily doctest/doctest.\+h} because it\textquotesingle{}s generated from {\ttfamily \doxylink{doctest__fwd_8h}{doctest/parts/doctest\+\_\+fwd.\+h}} and {\ttfamily \doxylink{doctest_8cpp}{doctest/parts/doctest.\+cpp}} -\/ they get concatenated by CMake -\/ so make sure you do a CMake build after you modify them so the {\ttfamily assemble\+\_\+single\+\_\+header} target gets built. Also take into consideration how the change affects the code coverage -\/ based on the project in {\ttfamily examples/all\+\_\+features}. Also update any relevant examples in the {\ttfamily examples} folder.

This framework has some design goals which must be kept. Make sure you have read the \doxysectlink{md_doctest_2doc_2markdown_2features}{{\bfseries{features and design goals}}}{0} page.

If your changes also change the output of the library -\/ you should also update the reference output for the tests or otherwise the CI builds will fail when they compare the latest output to the outdated reference output (which is committed in the repository). To do this run CMake with the {\ttfamily DOCTEST\+\_\+\+TEST\+\_\+\+MODE} variable set to {\ttfamily COLLECT} (making the new reference output) and then run {\ttfamily ctest} and commit the changed (or newly created) {\ttfamily .txt} files in the {\ttfamily test\+\_\+output} folders too. The default {\ttfamily DOCTEST\+\_\+\+TEST\+\_\+\+MODE} is {\ttfamily COMPARE}.

Example\+: {\ttfamily cmake -\/DDOCTEST\+\_\+\+TEST\+\_\+\+MODE=COLLECT path/to/sources \&\& cmake -\/-\/build . \&\& ctest}

Code should be formatted with a recent-\/enough {\ttfamily clang-\/format} using the config file in the root of the repo (or I will do it...)

Testing with compilers different from GCC/\+Clang/\+MSVC (and more platforms) is something the project would benefit from.
